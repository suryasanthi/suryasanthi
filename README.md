### Hi there! 👋

👩‍💻 I'm currently on an OpenSource sabbatical after more than 15 years of a global career, supporting Open Source Review Tool in Program Management and Marketing. I am also experienced in Product Management and HR.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on supporting your project in program management or marketing domains. 

📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suryas).
Here are some ideas to get you started:

💬 Ask me about:
- OSS Review Tool (ORT)
- Getting started in OpenSource
- Scaling a small OpenSource project into something bigger, by applying product management principles

In my free time I read, travel, and serve my todder and 🐱 cat overlords.

🏳️‍🌈 Pronouns: she/her.

PS: If you're looking to hire, I am open to the right opportunity, let's talk!
